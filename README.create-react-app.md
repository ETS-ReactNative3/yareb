# yareb - Yet Another React Electron Boilerplate

## Intro

On my path to obtaining some hands-on practical experience in DevOps, I decided to kill two birds with one stone, and decided to learn how to build cross platform applications using Electron and React while I'm at it. This README documents my learning path and the repo reflects the outcome. Since the end result is essentially Yet Another React Electron Boilerplate, I decided to call it just that - yareb. Since the Internet brought you here, I hope that you find some of this information and code useful.

## Step 1 - Setting up the development environment

First things first, you got to have `Node.js` and `npm` installed and this is a good place to start: [Download and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Then install your favorite IDE, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Step 2 - Creating a React Application

Now we're ready to create the very first application bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

On the terminal, run:

```bash
npx create-react-app yareb
```
After some while and a lot of terminal output, we get a final message saying `Happy hacking!` and we are ready to go and start our new React application by running:

```bash
cd yareb
yarn start
```
